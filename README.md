# Manual Tech Task ðŸ‘‹

This is a React Native app that I built for the Manual tech task.

This was my first time building a React Native app and I had a lot of fun doing it. I had some issues along the way but I had a good time learning the framework and I would like to continue working with React Native in the future.

## Technical information

I tried to keep this app as bare-bones as possible. The app is build using the `Expo` framework.

I made sure to follow `Expo`'s file structure.

I also used `i18n-js` for string localisation.
